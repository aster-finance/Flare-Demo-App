    <h1><strong>Problem: Missed Calls = Missed Business</strong> 💸</h1>
    <p>Small businesses are missing out on thousands of dollars because they can’t immediately pick up the phone. Customers often work with the company that responds to them the fastest. To solve the problem of missed calls, businesses employ expensive solutions, such as a receptionist or an outsourced answering service.</p>
    <h1><strong>Solution: Missed Calls</strong> ☎️ <strong>→ Immediate AI Text Message Conversations</strong> 💬</h1>
    <p>If a business misses a call, Twine texts the customer to find out why they were calling and can get them on their calendar. We integrate with existing VOIP and cell phone services with minimal setup time.</p>
    <p><em>Twine understands natural language and follows up with customers to get details and book services.</em></p>
    <h3 id="how-we-got-started"><strong>How we got started</strong></h3>
    <p>Anand started a networking &amp; audio/visual company in high school that eventually grew to six figures. He sold phone systems to small businesses and saw the revenue his customers left on the table due to missed calls.</p>
    <h1><strong>The Ask</strong> 👋</h1>
    <p>Do you know a small business owner that could benefit from Twine? If so, we'd be grateful for an introduction!</p>
